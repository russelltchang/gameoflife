# Game Of Life

My solution to freeCodeCamp's coding challenge, Build the Game Of Life. 

See it in action: https://codepen.io/russelltchang/full/ZoLLwN/.

## Required user stories:
* When I first arrive at the game, it will randomly generate a board and start playing.
* I can start and stop the board.
* I can set up the board.
* I can clear the board.
* When I press start, the game will play out.
* Each time the board changes, I can see how many generations have gone by.

## Tech stack and key packages:
* This application was built with ReactJS
